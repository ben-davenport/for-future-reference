Introduction to Geoprocessing and Mapping
=======================

We explore basic mapping using Geopandas, as well as geoprocessing steps such as projecting
coordinate systems, doing spatial joins and overlays, computing heatmaps, and doing distance
calculations.  All using open source libraries.
