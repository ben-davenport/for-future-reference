This demo introduces [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), which are code-based interfaces that allow outside developers to interact with a piece of software. We'll focus primarily on data-access APIs that operate over the web. In class we'll use Python to connect to a variety of APIs, from earthquake feeds and geocoders to public social media posts.


### Before class

1. **Save the demo files to your computer**

2. **From the command line, install this Python package for connecting to Twitter APIs:**  
   `pip install TwitterAPI`  
     
   There are a few different package managers for Python. We're using "pip install" instead of "conda install" because Conda doesn't include this package in its index.
