    "A boolean expression is one that can be evaluated by Python and interpreted as being True or False.  You can think of it as making an assertion, and having Python tell you if you are right or not in making that assertion.  It does not pass moral judgments, but will tell you if your assertion is not valid.    The == operator is an assertion that what is on the left of it is equivalent to what is on its right.  The >= operator is greater than or equal to, and != asserts that two objects are not the same. Don't be confused by the similarity of '=' and '==': one is an assignment of a value to a variable, and the other is a comparison operator.  Some examples of boolean expressions:"

You should have all the tools you need, by now, and just need a bit of practice at putting the pieces together to solve a problem.  The problem we want to solve is how to test whether a whole number is a prime number. Recall that a Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1 or itself, and it must be a whole number greater than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to have reusable code to test whether any number you want to test is a prime number you would need to do what? Write code that tests whether a number passed to a function meets these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise: write a function that accepts an argument (x), and prints whether or not x is a prime number.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether your results are correct, here is a link to a table of prime numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.mathsisfun.com/prime_numbers.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your function to test whether a number passed to it as an argument is a prime number, in the cell below."
